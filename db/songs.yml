      title: "verse 1"
      lyrics: |
        Come Thou Fount of every blessing
        Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
        Streams of mercy never ceasing
        Call for songs of loudest praise
        Teach me some melodious sonnet
        Sung by flaming tongues above
        Praise the mount I’m fixed upon it
        Mount of God’s redeeming love

      title: "verse 2"
      lyrics: |
        Here I raise my Ebenezer
        Hither to Thy help I’m come
        And I hope by Thy good pleasure
        Safely to arrive at home
        Jesus sought me when a stranger
        Wandering from the fold of God
        He to rescue me from danger
        Interposed His precious blood

      title: "verse 3"
      lyrics: |
        O to grace how great a debtor
        Daily I’m constrained to be
        Let Thy goodness like a fetter
        Bind my wandering heart to Thee
        Prone to wander Lord I feel it
        Prone to leave the God I love
        Here’s my heart O take and seal it
        Seal it for Thy courts above
